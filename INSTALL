Thanks for downloading cmsplugin-feed.

To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you're using ``pip``::

    pip install cmsplugin-feed

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``cmsplugin_feed`` 
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from somewhere on
your Python path; this is useful if your working from a Mercurial checkout.

Note that this application requires Python2.3 or later, and a functional
installation of Django 1.` or newer as well as a functional install of 
Django-CMS 2.` Final or newer. it also requires feedparser ::

    pip install feedparser
