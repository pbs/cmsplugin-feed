<h1>Playing fast and loose with the Six Degrees of Separation game, <em>American Masters</em> looks into its archives to see what the great American writer J.D. Salinger  has in common with the lives and careers of 11 other American Masters.</h1>
<div id="attachment_2839" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 139px"><img class="size-full wp-image-2839   " src="http://www-tc.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/files/2014/01/366px-Judy_Garland_-_publicity.JPG" alt="Judy Garland, circa 1940s." width="139" height="182" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Judy Garland, circa 1940s.</p></div>
<p><br class="blank" /><br />
<strong>Salinger was a fan of Judy Garland</strong><br />
J.D. Salinger (1919 &#8211; 2010) was a contemporary of <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/judy-garland/career-timeline/601/" target="blannk">Judy Garland</a> (1922 &#8211; 1969), the great entertainer whose singing and acting spanned radio, blockbuster films and cabaret.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;He talked a lot about Judy Garland and child actors, the innocence of actors and the beauty of their purity. He liked the innocence of childhood before pretension set in: the clear, simple way she sang in the <em>Wizard of Oz</em>.&#8221; &#8212; Jean Miller, Salinger&#8217;s longtime friend and romantic interest (source: <em><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/jd-salinger/book-introduction-to-salinger/2791/" target="_blank">Salinger</a></em>, by David Shields and Shane Salerno).</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_2719" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 200px"><img class="size-full wp-image-2719" src="http://www-tc.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/files/2013/09/200x100-bjkbjk.jpg" alt="Billie Jean King reacts during a match against Betty Ann Gruob Stuart, Jan. 8, 1974. AP Photo/SJV." width="200" height="100" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Billie Jean King reacts during a match against Betty Ann Gruob Stuart, Jan. 8, 1974. AP Photo/SJV.</p></div>
<p><br class="blank" /><strong>Salinger could have had a friendly volley with Billie Jean King</strong><br />
In the summer of 1930, city boy Jerome was sent to the affluent Camp Wigwam in Harrison, Maine, where according to John Skowe, a former staff writer at <em>Time, </em>the 11-year-old &#8221;played a fair game of tennis.&#8221;  On the opposite side of the country and many years later, tennis legend <a href=" on the opposite side of the country" target="_blank">Billie Jean King</a> (b. 1943) learned her moves at the age of 12, on the public courts of Long Beach, California.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"> </span></p>
<div id="attachment_2842" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 123px"><img class="size-full wp-image-2842  " src="http://www-tc.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/files/2014/01/220px-F_Scott_Fitzgerald_1921.jpg" alt="F.

Scott Fitzgerald in &quot;The World&#39;s Work&quot; (June 1921 issue).</p></div>
<p><br class="blank" /><strong>Salinger followed in the footsteps of F. Scott Fitzgerald</strong><br />
While  in his early 20s, J.D. Salinger hired the same literary agency that had represented <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/f-scott-fitzgerald/essay-the-crack-up/1028/" target="_blank">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a> (1896-1940): Harold Ober. The agent Dorothy Olding would represent Salinger for 50 years. Both Fitzgerald and Salinger won instant fame with their debut novels, Fitzgerald with <em>This Side of Paradise</em> (1920), and Salinger with <em><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/jd-salinger/infographic-the-path-to-the-catcher-in-the-rye/2790/" target="_blank">The Catcher in the Rye</a></em> (1951).</p>
<div id="attachment_2840" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 237px"><img class="size-full wp-image-2840 " src="http://www-tc.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/files/2014/01/Algonquin_Round_Table.gif" alt="Algonquin Round Table attendees Art Samuels, Charlie MacArthur, Harpo Marx, Dorothy Parker and Alexander Woollcott, circa 1919, the year J.D.

Salinger was born.</p></div>
<p><br class="blank" /><strong>Salinger would not have sat at the Algonquin Round Table<br />
</strong>Unlike the literati and entertainers that famously dined and drank together at the Algonquin Hotel in the 1920s, J.D. Salinger&#8217;s life post-<em>Catcher in the Rye</em> suggests he preferred more discreet companions. Salinger did not share the press-friendly attitude of the garrulous members of the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/the-algonquin-round-table/about-the-algonquin/527/" target="_blank">Algonquin Round Table</a>, even if it did include Harold Ross, founder of Salinger&#8217;s favorite magazine, <em>The New Yorker</em>. But Salinger was no stranger to the Algonquin itself. In the early 1970s, he took his love interest, the young writer Joyce Maynard, to the Algonquin to meet his friends William Shawn, Salinger&#8217;s editor at <em>The New Yorker</em>, and journalist Lillian Ross.</p>
<p><br class="blank" /><br />
<strong>The hearts of Salinger and Eugene O&#8217;Neill were broken by the same woman (who ran off with another American Master, Charlie Chaplain)</strong><br />

Native New Yorkers J.D. Salinger and playwright <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/eugene-oneill/about-eugene-oneill/676/" target="_blank">Eugene O&#8217;Neill</a> (1888 &#8211; 1953) had their hearts broken by the same young woman: Oona O&#8217;Neill, J.D.&#8217;s pre-war love interest and Eugene&#8217;s daughter, a fetching debutante. Oona married the much-older legend of silent film, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/charlie-chaplin/about-the-actor/77/" target="_blank">Charlie Chaplin</a> (1889 &#8211; 1977), and neither her disapproving father or Salinger ever spoke to her again.</p>

Charles Lanham in Hürtgen Forest, Germany, 1944. Salinger’s 4th Division fought there.</p></div>
<p><strong>World Wars deeply wounded Salinger and Ernest Hemingway</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/ernest-hemingway/career-timeline/630/" target="_blank"> Ernest Hemingway</a> (1899 &#8211; 1961) and J.D. Salinger were both deeply wounded by World Wars &#8212; Hemingway physically in the first, and Salinger psychologically in the second. While serving in World War II, Salinger met Hemingway, who gave the young writer encouraging feedback on <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>. According to <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/ernest-hemingway/filmmaker-interview-dewitt-sage/631/" target="_blank"><em>American Masters Ernest Hemingway</em> director DeWitt Sage</a>, World War I was a large influence on how Hemingway lived his life and wrote.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But on pain and on childhood, and early experience, the most dramatic thing that happened to Hemingway was that he was severely wounded in World War I. And I agree with what Ann Douglas, a professor at Columbia, says in the film, that he got away with his life and he also got away with material he would use for the rest of his life. I think this is true, but I don’t think it was an affirmative experience. I just think he was a born writer who somehow sensed that he had great material here to work with. Many great writers are the same. His grave wound gave him material and sensitized him, but he was already going to be a writer.&#8221; &#8212; DeWitt Sage</p></blockquote>
<p>David Shields, co-author of <em>Salinger,</em> sees <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/jd-salinger/film-outtake-the-impact-of-world-war-ii-on-salingers-writing/2827/" target="_blank">World War II as a &#8220;covert meditation&#8221;</a> in Salinger&#8217;s literary works. Though Salinger published stories about soldiers and veterans, unlike in the foreign settings and aggressive situations of Hemingway&#8217;s works, Salinger&#8217;s characters are confronted with domestic and ordinary circumstances, often paired with innocents. In a film outtake from <em>Salinger</em>, <em>Bookworm</em> radio host Michael Silverblatt points out that Salinger&#8217;s strength was his characters&#8217; poignant, sincere dialogues, yet he was writing in a time dominated by Hemingway, whose style was to leave most important things left unsaid.</p>

<p>The Polish-born American movie industry mogul <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/sam-goldwyn/about-sam-goldwyn/697/" target="_blank">Sam Goldwyn</a> (1882 &#8211; 1974) bought the film rights for Salinger&#8217;s story “Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut,” a critique of the shallowness of American suburbia. Goldwyn assembled a creative team, and spent much of 1949 transforming it into a sentimental love story,  <em>My Foolish Heart</em>.  Though the film gave Susan Hayward an Oscar nomination for best actress, Salinger could not stand what Goldwyn did with the story and critics didn&#8217;t like it much either.</p>
<div id="attachment_2017" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 275px"><img class="size-full wp-image-2017" src="http://www-tc.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/files/2012/03/inline-leeessaypic2.jpg" alt="Harper Lee poses for Life magazine in the old courthouse in Monroeville, Alabama, in 1961." width="275" height="191" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Harper Lee poses for Life magazine in 1961.</p></div>
<p><br class="blank" /><strong>Salinger and Harper Lee left us hanging</strong></p>
<p>Salinger&#8217;s and Harper Lee&#8217;s most famous protagonists were embraced by their younger readers: who didn&#8217;t feel like Holden Caulfield, and who didn&#8217;t want to be Scout or Jem Finch? And much to the dismay of their readership, both authors largely denied fans the future books they hoped to continue growing up and old with. One of the biggest best-sellers of all time, <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> (1960) is the first and only novel by <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/harper-lee-hey-boo/about-the-documentary/1972/" target="_blank">Harper Lee</a>, who once said that she wanted to be South Alabama’s Jane Austen. Lee won the Pulitzer Prize and became a mystery when she stopped speaking to press in 1964. Salinger&#8217;s last published short story, &#8220;Hapworth 16, 1924,&#8221; nearly filled the June 19, 1965 edition of <em>The New Yorker.</em> Its hero is a seven-year-old Seymour Glass writing a letter home from summer camp.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><em> </em></span></p>
<div id="attachment_1723" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 200px"><img class="size-full wp-image-1723" src="http://www-tc.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/files/2010/11/thumb-lennonyc.jpg" alt="John Lennon in New York City." width="200" height="100" /><p class="wp-caption-text">John Lennon in New York City.</p></div>
<p><strong><em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> tragically links Salinger and John Lennon</strong></p>
<p>Mark David Chapman, who shot and killed the musician and former Beatles member <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/lennonyc/john-and-yoko-walk-in-central-park/1673/" target="_blank">John Lennon</a> (1940 &#8211; 1980) outside his New York City apartment on December 8, 1980, admitted an affinity to the character Holden Caulfield, who despised phony people.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’m not blaming a book. I blame myself for crawling inside of the book and I certainly want to say J.D. Salinger and <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> didn&#8217;t cause me to kill John Lennon. In fact, I wrote to J. D. Salinger, I got his box number from someone, and I apologized to him for this. I feel badly about that. It’s my fault. I crawled in, found my pseudo-self within these pages&#8230;and played out the whole thing.&#8221;&#8211; Mark David Chapman</p></blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<div id="attachment_2671" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 200px"><img class="size-full wp-image-2671" src="http://www-tc.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/files/2013/08/am-baldwin-civilrights-thumb.jpg" alt="Writer and Civil Rights activist James Baldwin (left) with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr." width="200" height="100" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Writer and Civil Rights activist James Baldwin (left) with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p></div>
<p><strong>Salinger and James Baldwin gave us rebellious protagonists and both have protective estates</strong></p>
<p>The writers <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/james-baldwin/film-james-baldwin-the-price-of-the-ticket/2632/" target="_blank">James Baldwin</a> (1924 &#8211; 1987) and Salinger were born and raised in New York City, where Baldwin grew up poor in Harlem and Salinger rich on Park Avenue. Salinger&#8217;s debut novel in 1951 featured a rebellious prep-school student fed up with all the &#8220;phony&#8221; people. Baldwin&#8217;s autobiographical first novel, <em>Go Tell it on the Mountain</em> (1953) questions the constraints of the Christian Church and reveals the father he struggled against was not truly his. As they did in their lifetimes, their estates protect their writing and correspondence vigilantly, even if Salinger suffered breaches in others&#8217; memoirs and the recent Internet posting of stories scooped from the archives of Princeton University and The University of Texas.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The situation, for anyone still in doubt, is that if J.D. Salinger or James Baldwin writes you a letter, then you own the paper and the ink, but ownership of the contents &#8211; the intellectual property &#8211; resides with the author and then, for 70 years after the author&#8217;s death, his or her estate (minor variations apply from country to country). The judge in the Salinger case [barring Ian Hamilton's Salinger biography] allowed practically no application of fair use to unpublished correspondence.&#8221; &#8212; James Campbell, author of a book on James Baldwin, in an article in the <em>Guardian</em> in 2005.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Editor, novelist and playwright A.E. Hotchner talks about  J.D. Salinger&#8217;s last short story in <em>Cosmopolitan</em> magazine in 1948. Salinger gave the manuscript to his friend Hotchner, then an editor at <em>Cosmopolitan</em>, while they were playing poker at the Greenwich Village tavern Chumley&#8217;s. An adamant Salinger warned Hotchner that &#8220;not one word can be changed.&#8221; A note attached to it said, &#8220;Either as is or not at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to Hotchner, other editors at the magazine had made a single edit.  Salinger&#8217;s title for the story, which hinges on an African-American jazz singer&#8217;s tragic death, was &#8220;Scratchy Needle on a Phonograph Record.&#8221; In its September 1948 issue, <em>Cosmopolitan</em> changed the title to &#8220;Blue Melody.&#8221; Hotchner chose to break the news to his friend, &#8220;Jerry,&#8221; over a beer in Chumley&#8217;s. Salinger was furious at what he saw as a betrayal of his trust. </p>
<p>That year, Salinger began a close relationship with the magazine he admired and preferred to be published in, <em>The New Yorker</em>, which gave him a &#8220;first-look&#8221; contract for his stories. </p>

The Catcher [...]]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Touching a nerve in readers and critics alike, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, J.D. Salinger&#8217;s first novel, was &#8220;a very revolutionary book for the America of the early 1950&#8217;s,&#8221; according to Elizabeth Frank, a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and professor of Modern Languages and Literature at Bard College.</p>

<p><em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> was an instant success upon publication in July 1951. By August it was on <em>The New York Times</em> best-seller list and had been reprinted five times. However, the book also faced bans for &#8220;bad language,&#8221; &#8220;vulgarity&#8221; and &#8220;sexual references.&#8221; By 1963, the American Book Publisher&#8217;s Council reported that <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> had become the most censored book in American public schools. It remains a frequently censored book to this day.</p>
<p>In light of the social norm of conformity in the 1950s, Elizabeth Franks calls discovering the novel&#8217;s protagonist Holden Caulfield &#8220;exhilarating.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Holden Caulfield was a champion of bad words and cutting school and pointing out the dreariness and the hypocrisy of that era. I remain grateful to Holden Caulfield and to <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> for helping us put a name to all those intuitions we had that something was terribly wrong with civilization in America at that time,&#8221; says Frank.</p>
<p><em>American Masters</em> launches its 28th season with the series’ 200th episode: the exclusive director’s cut of Shane Salerno’s documentary, <em>Salinger</em>, premiering nationally Tuesday, January 21, 9-11:30 p.m. on PBS (check local listings) with 15 minutes of new material not seen in theaters.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first experience of reading that book is magical,&#8221; says Norton of <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, &#8220;especially if you&#8217;re lucky enough to read it when you&#8217;re Holden&#8217;s age.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this film outtake from <em>Salinger</em>, writer David Shields discusses the relationship between Salinger&#8217;s writing and his grisly experience of World War II, where he faced both the D-Day landing and the atrocities at a subcamp of the concentration camp Dachau.</p>

<p>David Shields sees World War II as a &#8220;covert meditation&#8221; in Salinger&#8217;s literary work. He relates Salinger&#8217;s wartime experiences to the depressed characters in his short stories, including the forlorn sergeant in <em>For Esmé With Love and Squalor</em> (1950) and Seymour Glass, a World War II veteran whose depression in <em>A Perfect Day for Bananafish</em> (1948) leads to suicide. </p>
<p>As a man who was half-Jewish, half-Irish, &#8220;the horrors of World War II spoke particularly powerfully to him,&#8221; says Shields of J.D. Salinger. </p>
<p>David Shields is the co-author with Shane Salerno of <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/jd-salinger/book-introduction-to-salinger/2791/"><em>Salinger</em>, the official book</a> of the documentary film.</p>
